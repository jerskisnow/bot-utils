# Contributing to the Development of **bot-utils**
So you want to help me make **bot-utils** better? Well to get you started here's a couple do's and don'ts:

### Do:
- Build (`npm run build`) and test (`npm run test`) before making a PR. It's a lot easier on me and more importantly the CI
- Document your new functions and code additions using [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/).
- Give credit! If you took your new function from Stack Overflow or someone on your Discord, use JSDoc's [@author](https://jsdoc.app/tags-author.html) tag to give them so credit!
- Link the Documentation of any new packages you add into **bot-utils**. It helps me and other contributors a lot :)

### Don't:
- Remove functions and utilities added by other people without reason. __If you do have a reason for it please explain it thoroughly in your PR.__
